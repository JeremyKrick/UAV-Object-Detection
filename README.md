## Object Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)  
The main challenge facing UAVs is maintaining a safe distance from 
obstacles, a task known as sense and avoid (SAA). Despite careful route planning and generally sparse 
airspace, autonomous drones may still unexpectedly encounter airborne or static obstacles in their path. 
The autonomous SAA system for UAVs is responsible for handling situational awareness, decision-
making, and control of the aircraft to execute evasive maneuvers effectively. To address this issue 
various sensing options are available on UAVs, such as radar, LIDAR, passive electro-optical sensors, and 
passive acoustic sensors. However, using visual cameras for the SAA task is appealing due to their 
lightweight and cost-effectiveness (Amazon Prime Air, 2021).
